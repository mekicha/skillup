Skill Sharing Site in Flask
===========================

What I am trying to build is a simple skill sharing platform, where anybody can register and share their
skill. I am yet to define what skill means in this context, so feel free to define it yourself.

Here is the basic requirements off the top of my head:

1. A user can register
2. A registered user can login
3. A logged in user can share, that is make a post about skill he wants to share.
4. Logged in users can see skills that others have shared.
5. Yes, at the moment there is nothing like I don't want others to see what I have posted.
6. There is no concept of user profile yet. Every logged in user sees the index page, containing
   all shared skills, if any.
   To make a user feel special, we will try to show her own posts first, followed by other less
   important ones :)
7. Obviously, a user can also log out

8. More features to be added with time. where time is undefined.

Note: Project is at baby stage at the moment. I will remove this line when it grows up.
